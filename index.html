        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p><strong>Graphic Design: A Cultural Reference to Our Society.</strong></p>

        <p>The most powerful graphics are those that speak most to our experiences, the collective narratives of our communities, and the opposition of what society has deemed the norm. But to appreciate Graphic Design pieces is to appreciate the cultural reference it points towards. Colors, typography, and composition don’t mean a thing without a cultural association. In this STS Graphic Design series, learn the deeper meaning of Graphic Design and its greater purpose of relaying complex messages in visual styles specific to its particular era.</p>

        <p>In this course, learn the power of Color Theory and its effect on Graphic Design pieces over the decades, understand the emotional impact colors can generate, and grasp the general rules of color to follow in order to best align with the most current Graphic Design style: minimalism. At the end of the lesson, complete the “Terrace Chair” project in Adobe Illustrator using the concepts you learned in class.</p>

    <section class="topic">
        <h1>Graphic Design & Culture</h1>
        <img src="images/01-graphic-design-intro.png" alt="graphic design is a cultural reference">
        <h2>What is Graphic Design?</h2>
        <p>In its simplest definition, <strong>Graphic Design is the combination of graphics, color, and fonts</strong>. BUT none of these are powerful until they <strong>promote a message relevant to a society</strong>, whether that be a group of people, an organization, or the entire world.</p>

        <h3>EXAMPLE 1: THE STOP SIGN</h3>
        <div class="full-width">
            <p>How do we identify a <strong>Stop Sign</strong>? How do we know to stop at one?</p>
            <img src="images/02-stop_sign.png" alt="stop sign">
            <p>Through exposure, particular graphics become meaningful. A Stop Sign is found all throughout a city, and society has defined the combination of its different components to mean the following: <strong>Stop otherwise there is danger</strong></p>
            <img src="images/03-stop_sign_components.png" alt="white sans-serif font, red color, and octagonal shape components that make up a stop sign">

            <p>But what if we were to come across a "Stop Sign" with an orange Curlz MT font instead of the white sans-serif font? Unless it eventually became the norm, we probably wouldn't take the sign so seriously, mostly because we were raised to expect certain features from Stop Signs.</p>
            <img class="border shadow rounded center" src="images/04-stop_sign_lol.gif" alt="gif of stop sign with orange curly font with LOL on top">
        </div>

        <h3>EXAMPLE 2: BATMAN</h3>
        <p>In the United States, Batman is a well known figure for many people. Whether you grew up with the original comic books, played with Batman action figures, or have merely heard of the films, Batman surely can't be missed or mistaken. Below, you will find three representations of Batman. Notice how they are all different in their own way, yet through consistant colors and shapes, the Batman brand can be recalled. But are colors, shapes, and (sometimes) text really the only way to identify Batman? NO. Rather, the way we can identify such colors, shapes, and text to be associated with Batman is through constant exposure of the character and brand.</p>
        <img src="images/04-batman.png" alt="batman logo">


        <h2>Exposure to Culture Grants Us Access To Create.</h2>
        <p>Even though art does not come naturally to everyone, everyone is still capable of understanding popular cultural references and replicating the techniques used to send a message. Our constant surrounding of graphic design work give us examples of what a project nowadays should look like and contain.</p>
        <img src="images/05-cultural_reference.png" alt="picture of tiny succulents from real life to graphic design">
        <img src="images/06-cultural_reference.png" alt="example of minimalistic poster">
        <div class="important center full-width">
            <p>This definition of culture deals with the production of messages and understanding through exposure of particular everyday visuals and styles. This should not, however, be an excuse to steal and profit off cultural realities by marginalized communities, or celebrate stereotypes. <strong>Do appreciate, don’t appropriate</strong>.</p>

        <h1>FUN-damentals: Lines, Shapes, and Forms</h1>
        <h2>Watch this <strong>Awesome Fundamentals of Design Video</strong></h2>
        <iframe width="860" height="520" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YqQx75OPRa0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

        <h2>Line</h2>
        <p>Lines are the <strong>connection of any two points</strong> which can be straight, jagged, or curvy. In Graphic Design, lines can organize content, make illustrations, or add detail to any work.</p>
        <img src="images/07-line.png" alt="examples of straight, jagged, and curvy lines">

        <h2>Shape</h2>
        <p>A shape is an <strong>enclosed outline of an object</strong> composed of intersecting ends of lines. Shapes can be either <strong>geometric</strong> or <strong>organic</strong>. In Graphic Design, shapes can help organize content, make illustrations, or add detail to any work.</p>
        <img src="images/08-shape.png" alt="examples of geometric and organic shapes">
        <h3>Geometric/Regular Shape</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Geometric shapes, are mathematically calculated to have perfect measurement ratios throughout its enclosure (ex. square, circle, triangle, rectangle, octagon, etc.)</li>
            <li>Geometric shapes can be used to create simplistic and visually-pleasing versions of any person, place, or thing.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Organic Shape</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Organic shapes are non-perfect and free-form.</li>
            <li>Organic shapes can always be broken down into several overlapping geometric shapes.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Form</h2>
        <p>Forms are the <strong>three-dimensional version</strong> of any given shape. Forms are created when <strong>light, shadow, and perception</strong> are added to create a notion of depth and a touch of realism.</p>
        <img src="images/09-form.png" alt="examples of forms">

        <h2>Texture</h2>
        <p>Texture is the feel, appearance or consistancy of a surface. Texture can be implied through Graphic Design art with lines, shapes, and/or forms. Texture adds depth and tactility to images that would otherwise seem flat.</p>
        <img src="images/10-texture.png" alt="examples of texture in graphic design">

        <h2>Balance</h2>
        <img src="images/11-balance_examples.png" alt="examples of org flyers">
        <img src="images/11-balance-business-cards.png" alt="business cards">
        <img src="images/11-balance.png" alt="image of example webpage layout">
        <p>Balance is the equal distribution of <strong>visual weight</strong> on a physical or digital canvas. “Visual weight” consists of all the objects (lines, shapes, text) within a canvas space and their inherited properties (color, size, number). A project’s balance can also be affected by the <strong>negative space </strong>created in the presence of objects, such as, but not limited to, <strong>margins</strong>.</p>

        <h2>Negative/Blank/White Space</h2>
        <p>Negative space is the space that surrounds an object in a canvas which sometimes creates the illusion of other shapes.</p>
        <h3>More Obvious Examples</h3>
        <p>Below is a poster created by SANCCOB in an effort to save African penquins.</p>
        <img class="border shadow rounded center" src="images/12-negative-space-penguin.jpg" alt="ad for SANCCOB, saving the penquins">

        <p>The graphic below was created by Israeli artist Noma Bar. Check out more of her work <a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/negative-space-illustrations-noma-bar/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=organic">here!</a></p>
        <img class="border shadow rounded center" src="images/12-negative-space-noma-bar.jpg" alt="image of boxing gloves creating arm muscles through negative space">

        <p>This design was created by Christopher DeLorenzo. See similar works by other artists <a href="https://www.template.net/design-templates/art/negative-space-illustration/">here!</a></p>
        <img class="border shadow rounded center" src="images/12-negative-space-delorenzo.jpg" alt="two silhouettes create an apple core using negative space">

        <h3>Less Obvious, Yet Most Common Examples:</h3>
        <p>Margins found in books, magazines, and website layouts are some of the most common examples of negative space that we can interact with daily. While it seems simple in comparison to the examples above, it's a reminder that pleasant-looking layouts and designs are not difficult to construct once we pay attention to detail.</p>

        <img src="images/12-margin-website.png" alt="book page and website layout example">

        <h3>Rule of Thirds</h3>
        <p>Sometimes negative space is not equally distributed on a canvas, which if done correctly, can help give visual balance to a project. The <strong>Rule of Thirds</strong> establishes a pretend grid on a canvas made up of two equidistant horizontal lines and two equidistant vertical lines. If a subject is placed on one of the four intersections, the canvas can become balanced and more visually pleasing.</p>
        <img src="images/12-rule-thirds.png" alt="rule of thirds example with wall and laptop">



        <h2>Minimalism (Very popular nowadays)</h2>
        <p>The limited use of colors and shapes to create a distinct and clean graphic.</p>
        <h3>1950s Coca Cola Ad Example:</h3>
        <img class="border shadow rounded center" src="images/13-coca-cola-ad-1950s.jpg" alt="coca cola ad from the 1950s depicting middle class family reaching out for a coke">
        <p class="center">1950s: Ad depicts people (particularly middle class white mother and her children), the product itself, typography (in a more curvy font), and many colors (more than 4). There is a sense of realism in the ad, and the target audience is obvious: white middle class families.</p>

        <h3>1990s Coca Cola Ad Example:</h3>
        <img class="border shadow rounded center" src="images/14-coca-cola-ad-1990s.jpg" alt="coca cola ad from the 1990s depicting a glass bottle of coke">
        <p class="center">1990s: Ad depicts no people, just the product, as well as less type and color than the 1950s ad. There is still a sense of realism in the ad, but the target audience is more general with its lack of people in the ad.</p>

        <h3>2010s Coca Cola Ad Example:</h3>
        <img class="border shadow rounded center" src="images/15-coca-cola-ad-2010s.jpg" alt="coca cola ad from the 2010s depicting new tall coke can with giraffe reference in minimalistic style">
        <p class="center">2010s: Ad depicts no people, little type, and a new product. Colors are limited to two (red and white) The graphic is minimal compared to the 50s and 90s ad. Notice how the ad’s simplicity creates a more inclusive feel of who the product targets. It should also be mentioned that Coca-Cola’s iconic reputation and popularity allows it so that this minimalism is effective.</p>


        <h2>Raster Vs. Vector Images</h2>
        <h3>Raster Images:</h3>
        <img class="border shadow rounded center" src="images/16-raster-image.gif" alt="gif zooming into a cactus raster image">

        <p>Raster images have a set <strong>number of pixels</strong>, and if expanded beyond their limits, these images become <strong>blurry or “pixelated”</strong>. The most popular example of raster images are <strong>photographs</strong> taken by cameras and the most common image formats include jpg, gif, png, tif, bmp, psd, eps and pdfs originating from raster programs.</p>

        <p>Common raster programs are photo editing / paint programs such as <strong>Photoshop & Paint Shop, GIMP</strong>. Depending on the complexity of the image, conversion to a vector image is doable, but may be time consuming.</p>
        <div class="good-to-know center">

            <h3>Why Is My Picture Blurry?!</h3>
            <p>Have you ever downloaded a small image file and increased its size only to realize it’s now blurry and unattractive? That’s because it had a low pixel count.</p>
            <p>The higher the pixels, the larger the file. The lower the pixels, the smaller the file.</p>

            <p>When downloading images from the web, aim to download the largest file possible to avoid any disappointment. <strong>It's always preferable to scale down than to scale up with raster images</strong>.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Vector Images:</h3>
        <img class="border shadow rounded center" src="images/17-vector-image.gif" alt="gif zooming into a cactus vector image">
        <p>Vector images are composed of <strong>paths through mathematical equations</strong>. This means they can be scaled up (or down) with no distortion because the mathematical calculations shift accordingly to maintain the image’s original look. This <strong>resolution-independence</strong> results in the ability to be printed at any size and resolution. Unlike raster images, vector graphic dimensions do not reflect their file size, meaning a very large vector image meant to be printed for a billboard can be saved as a very small file size in comparison.</p>

        <p>Vector programs such as <strong>Adobe Illustrator</strong> are best for creating logos, drawings and illustrations, and for images that will be applied to physical products (ex. Mugs, stickers, etc.) The number of colors can easily be increase or reduced to adjust printing budgets. Common vector graphic file formats include <strong>ai, cdr, svg, and eps & pdfs</strong> originating from vector programs. Vector images can become raster images once saved as a jpeg or png.</p>

        <h2>The Color Wheel</h2>
        <img src="images/18-the-color-wheel.png" alt="the color wheel">

        <h3>Primary Colors:</h3>
        <p>Red, Yellow, Blue (all other colors are derived from these 3 hues)</p>
        <img src="images/19-primary-colors.png" alt="primary colors">

        <h3>Secondary Colors:</h3>
        <p>Orange, Green, Purple (formed from primary colors)</p>
        <img src="images/20-secondary-colors.png" alt="secondary colors">

        <h3>Tertiary Colors</h3>
        <p>Yellow-orange, Red-orange, Red-purple, Blue-green, Yellow-green, Blue-purple (formed from mixing primary colors and secondary colors</p>
        <img src="images/21-tertiary-colors.png" alt="tertiary colors">

        <h3>Warm vs. Cool Colors</h3>
        <p>Red through yellow hues on the Color Wheel are typically considered <strong>warm colors</strong> as they tend to remind us of the sun or fire which evoke warmth</p>
        <p>Green through violet hues on the Color Wheel are typically considered <strong>cool colors</strong> as they tend to remind us of water or grass which evoke a cool feeling</p>
        <img src="images/22-warm-cool-colors.png" alt="color wheel depicting warm and cool color sections">

        <h2>Black and White (Not Colors, But Great Neutral Choices)</h2>
        <p>While black and white are technically NOT colors, their pure form offers a neutrality that is great for balancing any Graphic Design project. Black and white make it possible for more colors beyond those on the Color Wheel to exist!</p>
        <img src="images/23-black-white.png" alt="chart showing black and white tints/shades">



        <h3>Black = Shade</h3>
        <p><strong>Shade:</strong> dark values that are made by mixing a color with black - for examples, maroon is a shade of red, and navy is a shade of blue. Black absorbs all colors.</p>
        <img src="images/24-shade-example.png" alt="image showing red and maroon colors">


        <h3>White = Tint</h3>
        <p><strong>Tint:</strong> light values that are made by mixing a color with white - for example, pink is a tint of red, and light blue is a tint of blue. White reflects all colors.</p>
        <img src="images/25-tint-example.png" alt="image showing red and pink colors">

        <div class="good-to-know full-width">
            <strong>Tone:</strong> adding <strong>grey</strong> to colors. This allows there to be even MORE hues (colors) available when designing.
        </div>

        <h2>Color Harmony (Palettes)- "Starting Point Formulas"</h2>
        <p>All of the examples below have the base color as Red.</p>

        <div class="tool-reference">
            <h3>Monochromatic</h3>
            <img src="images/26-monochromatic.png" alt="monochromatic colors paint chip">
            <p>This type of color palette is created using different values and saturations from one base color.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="tool-reference">
            <h3>Analogous</h3>
            <img src="images/27-analogous.png" alt="analogous colors paint chip">
            <p>This type of color palette is created using colors that are on either side of the base color on the Color Wheel.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="tool-reference">
            <h3>Complementary</h3>
            <img src="images/28-complementary.png" alt="complementary colors paint chip">
            <p>This type of color palette is created using the color straight across from the base color on the Color Wheel.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="tool-reference">
            <h3>Split Complementary</h3>
            <img src="images/29-split-complementary.png" alt="split complementary colors paint chip">
            <p>This type of color palette is created using colors that are on either side of the base color’s complement.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="tool-reference">
            <h3>Triadic</h3>
            <img src="images/30-traidic.png" alt="triadic colors paint chip">
            <p>This type of color palette is created using three evenly spaced colors from the Color Wheel.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="tool-reference">
            <h3>Tetradric</h3>
            <img src="images/31-tetradic.png" alt="tetradic colors paint chip">
            <p>This type of color palette is created using two complementary color pairs from the Color Wheel.</p>

        </div>

        <h2>Adjusting Your Color Harmony Formulas</h2>
        <p>Colors have been studied to <strong>evoke certain emotions and reactions</strong> when in their presence. While the exact observations for specific colors may not hold truth for every individual’s experience with them, it is important to understand that the cultural input placed onto colors still leads to certain emotional manipulations nonetheless.</p>

        <h3>Red</h3>
        <p><em>passionate, aggressive, important</em></p>
        <img src="images/32-red.png" alt="red monochromatic palette">
        <ul>
            <li>Adds “gravity and heightened awareness” - increases blood circulation, breathing rates, metabolism</li>
            <li>Associations to both love and war but also importance - think red carpet</li>
            <li>Triggers stimulation, appetite, hunger</li>
            <li>Attracts attention.</li>
            <li><em>Example: Fast Food Logos/Interior Design</em></li>
        </ul>


        <h3>Orange</h3>
        <p><em>playful, energetic, cheap</em></p>
        <img src="images/33-orange.png" alt="orange monochromatic palette">
        <ul>
            <li>Excitement about something without severity</li>
            <li>Creates haste and please on impulse - signify health and suggesting vitality and vibrance</li>
            <li><em>Example: Clearance items marked in orange</em></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Yellow</h3>
        <p><em>happy, friendly</em></p>
        <img src="images/34-yellow.png" alt="yellow monochromatic palette">
        <ul>
            <li>Happiness - activates the anxiety center of the brain - stimulate and vitalize (think signs and taxis)</li>
            <li>Darker shades such as gold adds more weight and gives it a sense of antiquity</li>
            <li><em>Example: Fast Food Logos/ Interior Design Cont’d: Yellow triggers the feelings of happiness and friendliness, making fast food logos and interior design attractive and inviting</em></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Green</h3>
        <p><em>natural, stable, prosperous</em></p>
        <img src="images/35-green.png" alt="green monochromatic palette">
        <ul>
            <li>Environment, outdoors - nature and organic qualities</li>
            <li>Most balanced color, offers sense of stability</li>
            <li><em>Example: Bank logos (idea that your green (money) is safe here!)</em></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Blue</h3>
        <p><em>refreshing, free</em></p>
        <img src="images/36-blue.png" alt="blue monochromatic palette">
        <ul>
            <li>Darker blues - somber, heightened security, nobility and professionalism</li>
            <li>Often said to make one stay longer in its presence</li>
            <li><em>Example: Facebook, Culvers</em></li>

        </ul>

        <h3>Purple</h3>
        <p><em>luxurious, mysterious, romantic</em></p>
        <img src="images/37-purple.png" alt="purple monochromatic palette">
        <ul>
            <li>Luxury - elegance, high-end appeal </li>
            <li>Lighter shades of purple - spring and romance (lavender)</li>
            <li>Darker shades of purple - mystery, creativity, sensual romantic elements</li>

            <h2>Graphic Design Tip:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Typically <strong>choose 1-4 colors</strong> for a Graphic Design project when focusing on a minimalistic style; this ensures that your colors will be balanced and gives room to play around with shades and tints of those colors.</li>
                <li><strong>Color Dominance →</strong> be purposeful with every color you choose and how much dominance you give to each. The greater the vibrance or space a color takes up within a canvas, the greater dominance it holds.</li>

        <h2>Introduction to Project</h2>
        <p>Integrating what you have learned in this course about Color Theory, you will use the designated tools in Illustrator to create four versions of a <strong>Memorial Union Poster</strong> with a terrace chair graphic. Each version of the poster will have a different color palette to showcase how a variety of color combinations can be used to make a pleasant minimalistic poster design. Keep in mind that the only factor changing between designs is color; not layout, composition nor typography.
